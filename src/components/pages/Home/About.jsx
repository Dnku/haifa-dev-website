        <h4>Who are we?</h4>
        <p>
          We're an enthusiastic group of developers from Haifa. Some of us are
          professionals, some are still learning, but all of us agree upon one
          thing: Haifa offers barely enough for local developers to thrive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nobody wants to move far away from the place they call home just to
          establish a career. We don't think anyone should. That's why we've
          established Haife:Dev, so that all of Haifa's developers will have{" "}
          <b>a reason to stay in Haifa</b>.

        <h4>What do we want?</h4>
        <p>We want our careers to thrive in the city we call home.</p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to bring professional software-related content to Haifa{" "}
          <b>for free</b>. We aim to organize meetups and other events that can
          help developers in Haifa develop their career without the need to
          leave their home, or travel even farther if the live in the north.

        <p>
          We're establishing partnership with local companies and office
          complexes as hosts for our professional meetups. We're bringing
          professional developers and lectors from all around the country to
          provide top quality content to our dearest Haifa developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          For beginners and students, we've partnered with{" "}
          <a href="http://www3.haifa.muni.il/inventuipub/">In-Vent</a> to
          establish weekly study group meetups in association with the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freeCodeCamp</a> non-profit
          organization.
